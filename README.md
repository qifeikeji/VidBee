### 🍎 macOS Installation Notes

After downloading and installing VidBee on macOS, you may encounter a "file is damaged" error when trying to run the application. This is due to macOS security restrictions on applications downloaded from the internet.

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/VidBee.app/
```

This command removes the quarantine attribute that macOS applies to applications downloaded from the internet, allowing VidBee to run properly without the "file is damaged" error.

### 🌐 Browser Script (Quick Download)

For a more convenient downloading experience, you can install the VidBee browser script to add a quick download button directly on supported video websites.
